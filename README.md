# Skidded-Malwares

These are Skidded Malwares from users who copy and paste gdi and sounds, edit them, bad made batch files and VBScripts, and uses trojan generators.

If you want to try one of these crappy made viruses, then I suggest you use a virtual machine because some of them might be destructive and may harm your PC by deleting or overwriting the mbr, removes any necessary system files, and make the computer usable.

You may need to install Visual C++ 2015-2022 redistributable (x86) and (64x) and net. framework 3.5 - 4.8.1 in order to make these viruses to work without any issues (for some of them)
