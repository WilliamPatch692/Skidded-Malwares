# Skidded-Malwares

These are Skidded Malwares from users who copy and paste gdi and sounds, edit them, bad made batch files and VBScripts, and uses trojan generators.

If you want to try one of these crappy made viruses, then I suggest you use a virtual machine because some of them might be destructive and may harm your PC by deleting or overwriting the mbr, removes any necessary system files, and make the computer usable
